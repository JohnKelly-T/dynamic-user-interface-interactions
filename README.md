# Dynamic User Interface Interactions

A small assignment for The Odin Project to practice creating interactive ui components using javascript.

## Dropdown Menu
The first task was to create a dropdown menu and to publish it in npm. The published npm package is what's used for the dropdown in the live demo with styling customizations. 

You can check the npm package here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@johnkelly-t/dropdown-menu

## Image Carousel

The task was to create a simple image carousel which can change images through user interaction. I decided to add more functionality by adding a sliding effect with the use of css position and transition.

## Tech stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
